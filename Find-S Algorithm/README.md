# Find-S Algorithm

**Problem** : Implement and demonstrate the FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data from a .CSV file.
Algorithm : Find-S, a Maximally Specific Hypothesis Learning Algorithm

**Step1:** Initialize h to the most specific hypothesis in H.

**Step2:** For each positive training instance x For each attribute constraint ai in h If the constraint ai in h is satisfied by x then do nothing else replace ai in h by the next more general constraint that is satisfied by x.

**Step3:** Output hypothesis h
